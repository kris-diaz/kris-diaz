  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Howdy! My name is Christian, however, you may also call me Kris! I'm an undergraduate student at the University of South Florida studying Physics & Astronomy. 
    In addition to my academic work, I'm currently a research assistant at the USF Optical and Laser Spectroscopy Laboratory, where I work on a variety of projects involving ultrafast 2D-IR spectroscopy of novel antiferromagnetic semiconductors.

    <br><br>
    I'm also an officer for the USF Society of Physics Students (SPS) club, where I have had the opportunity to collaborate with other students and faculty members.
    <!-- <br>
    Some of my personal interests include astrophotography, volunteer work and mountain biking. I try to cultivate spaces that are inclusive of people of all walks of life, whether that be in my volunteer work or personal life.

    Beyond my research and academic pursuits, I enjoy going on walks, homelabbing, astrophotography, and brewing tea. My favorite tea is a blend of green elderberry tea, lemon peel, ginger, and raspberry flavoring.
